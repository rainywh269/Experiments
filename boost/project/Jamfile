# This is the root of an independent project
project-root ;

# Declares the following targets:
#    
#  1. an extension module called "getting_started1", which is
#     built from "getting_started1.cpp". Built by default
#
#  2. A test target called my-test.test which runs
#     test_getting_started1.py with the extension module above. Built
#     when out-of date, but only if invoked by name or if the global
#     "test" target is invoked.
#
#  3. A test target called my-test.run wihch runs the above test
#     unconditionally. Built only when invoked by name.
#
# To see verbose test output, add "-sPYTHON_TEST_ARGS=-v" to the bjam
# command-line before the first target.
